# ℹ️ REPO DESCRIPTION
This repository has been made after my personal interest in Quantum Computing and it rapid development into an easily accessible form. This list will not be exhaustive and will perpetually be a WIP. I cannot guarantee that it will be free form errors. But the actual content will be referenced.

# 🎓LEARNING RESOURCES OF QC

These are going to links to resources which have a simplified explanation of QC, which are not math heavy. With a greater focus on videos rather than papers. 

# 🎛️ FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF QC

These prinicples will be all in illustratins and diagramatic form. These diagrams will be either native github `mermaid` diagrams or external sources 

## Atomic Structure 




## [Quantum Mechanics](https://www.livescience.com/33816-quantum-mechanics-explanation.html) 

Defined as a sub field of physics that describes interaction between particles of the sub atomic realm. *Sub Atomic* referring to the particles that form the atoms, and those particles that form the atoms.
